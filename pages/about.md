# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** (or you may know me as Kai/Kai Hou from my publications) :wave:,<br>
So I gathered if you bump into this page, you probably want to learn my background. I am a PhD student pursuing a [CDT in Data Intensive Science](http://www.hep.ucl.ac.uk/cdt-dis/) at UCL. I am also a member of [CSED](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/space-exochemistry-data/), [ExoAI](http://exoai.eu/) and the [Ariel Consortium](https://arielmission.space/). My research focuses on applying Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to help us better understand exoplanets (aka planets outside our solar system), and in particular their atmospheres. You can find my past and current works in Projects.
