- title: Ph.D. Candidate, CDT in Data Intensive Science
  from: 2017
  to: present
  description: My PhD research focuses on applying machine learning techniques within the context of exoplanet characterisation. I pioneered the use of Explainable AI techniques in exoplanetary science and showed that deep learning models can learn molecular features without any prior physical knowledge.

- title: Alan Turing Intern, TRL
  from: 2020 Nov
  to: 2021 Feb
  description: I was responsible to a build a prototype deep learning based model to predict the onset of traffic incidents. I have also written a dedicated data pipeline to extract, clean and transform raw data from live traffic record into data product ready for machine learning applications or data visualisations.

- title: Placement Student, Alan Turing Institute
  from: 2020 Jan
  to: 2020 Jul
  description: My 6 months placement at ATI was split between two projects. 1. "Learning Machine Project" The primary focus of the project is to design and build a dedicated framework to update, train and interpret machine learning models for healthcare and justice application. 2. "DECOVID-19". The second half of my placement is spent to develop a dedicated python package to produce descriptive statistics for incoming COVID-19 data.

- title: Student, UCL Astrophysics
  from: 2013 Sept
  to: 2017 Sept
  description: I obtained a Master's degree in Astrophysics with First Class Honour at UCL. I won the Best Performance in Astrophysics during my 3rd and 4th Year.
