  description: I was responsible to a build a prototype deep learning based model to predict the onset of traffic incidents. I have also written a dedicated data pipeline to extract, clean and transform raw data from live traffic record into data product ready for machine learning applications or data visualisations.

  description: My PhD research focuses on applying machine learning techniques within the context of exoplanet characterisation. I pioneered the use of Explainable AI techniques in exoplanetary science and showed that deep learning models can learn molecular features without any prior physical knowledge.
