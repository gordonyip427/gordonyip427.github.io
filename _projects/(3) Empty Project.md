description: Sensitivity analysis for machine learning and deep learning models. This perturbation based analysis helps to quantify the relative importance of each input features w.r.t. the target(s). We developed this technique in order to verify whether our trained model aligns with our physical intuition, in our case exoplanet spectroscopy. The full details of our project can be found here.
