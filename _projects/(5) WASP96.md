description: This work analysed transit signal coming from WASP-96 b, a hot Neptune class exoplanet. After detrending raw-lightcurves from HST grism data, we discovered water signature on the planet's atmosphere. However, we also realised an abrupt discrepancy between ground based and space based instruments. Click to learn more.
